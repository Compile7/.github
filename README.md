# Welcome to Compile7 👋

A non-profit organization dedicated to creating open-source tools that simplify complex tasks for developers.

## Our Mission

At Compile7, we believe that developers should be able to focus on building great software without wrestling with infrastructure. That's why we create open-source tools that simplify complex tasks, particularly in the areas of:

- 🔐 Authentication
- 🛡️ Security
- 🏢 Enterprise Integration

## Our Core Values

- **Open Source First** - We believe in the power of open source to drive innovation and collaboration
- **Developer Experience** - We're obsessed with creating tools that developers actually enjoy using
- **Security as Priority** - We build security into everything we do, not as an afterthought
- **Community Driven** - Our roadmap is shaped by the needs of our community
